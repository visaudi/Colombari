       <blockquote>&#x201c;[A] fortunate audience assembled on the steps of Grant&#x2019;s Tomb [for] &#x201c;More Or Less I Am,&#x201d; an hour of spoken word, song, dance, and music based on Walt Whitman&#x2019;s 1855 poem &#x201c;Song of Myself.&#x201d; Karin Coonrod, who created and directed the show, offered these words of introduction: 'Hold on to your hats.' Whitman would rather we&#x2019;d thrown them in the air in delight, and at countless moments during the performance I&#x2019;d have done just that (if I'd had a hat). ... It was a chilly evening...[but] the performers, lighted from below on a rudimentary set, came in close to the audience, and the ruckus they kicked up seemed to keep everyone warm. ...
